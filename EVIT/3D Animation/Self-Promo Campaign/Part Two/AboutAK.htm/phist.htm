<p class="p style2">Many events have occurred to me over the years, some good and some bad.  Some of the good things include: an IQ test at age 4, hooking a sea lion, making 
powerful friends and acquaintances, collecting things, and more.</p>
<p class="style2">When I was 4 years old, I displayed terrific memorial skills when I recited a song that I had heard once the day before word for word, tone for tone.  My parents were impressed, and (though I do not know which one, or even if both of them did it) an unidentified party enrolled me in a program for gifted children.  My test results showed that at the time, I had the intelligence of a child twice my age.  Later, I was pulled from the program.</p>

A good effect of these friendships is that I get to do things that most other students that attend my school are not allowed to do.  Even though I have these priveleges, I am normally respective towards my teachers and I do my best in order to be seen as a hard-working student.  Another positive effect that has occurred is that I have a positive reputation throughout the teachers that work at the campuses that I have used for at least two years.  Because of these relationships, I can be very friendly and respectful to my superiors in the workplace.</p>
