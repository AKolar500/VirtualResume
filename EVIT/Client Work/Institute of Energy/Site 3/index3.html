  <h3 class="style9">What is Petroleum? </h3>
  <p align="left">Petroleum  (L. petroleum, from Greek &pi;&epsilon;&tau;&rho;&#941;&lambda;&alpha;&iota;&omicron;&nu;, lit. &quot;rock oil&quot;) or crude oil  is a naturally occurring, flammable liquid found in rock formations in the  Earth consisting of a complex mixture of hydrocarbons of various molecular  weights, plus other organic compounds.<br />
    <br />
The term &quot;petroleum&quot; was first used in the treatise De Natura  Fossilium, published in 1546 by the German mineralogist Georg Bauer, also known  as Georgius Agricola.<br />
<img width="229" height="170" src="index3_clip_image001_0003.jpg" alt="http://evofh1l.devhub.com/img/upload/oil-well_.jpeg" align="left" /><br />
Petroleum is  basically a mix of naturally occurring organic compounds from within the earth  that contain primarily hydrogen, carbon and oxygen. When petroleum comes  straight out of the ground as a liquid it is called crude oil if dark and  viscous, and condensate if clear and volatile. When solid it is asphalt, and  when semi-solid it is tar. There is also natural gas, which can be associated  with oil or found alone.<br />
<br />
Crude oil comes in many forms. Usually it is black, but green, red or brown  oils are not uncommon. Thin and volatile oils are called &quot;light&quot;,  whereas thick and viscous ones are &quot;heavy&quot;. Light oils have an API  gravity of 30 to 40 degrees, which means that the density is much less than 1.0  g/cc. These oils float easily on water. By contrast, some heavy oils have an  API gravity of less than 12 degrees and are so dense that they sink, rather  than float, in water.<br />
<br />
Most oils are mixtures of many different compounds, most of which are  hydrocarbons. There are four main hydrocarbon groups in petroleum. The  saturates are hydrocarbons consisting of straight chains of carbon atoms.  Aromatics are hydrocarbons consisting of rings of carbon. Asphlatenes are  complex polycylic hydrocarbons that contain many complicated carbon rings, and  NSO compounds are mostly nitrogen, sulfur, and oxygen.<br />
<br />
In most  oils, the saturate fraction is the largest and is made up of two subgroups  called paraffins and isoprenoids. Paraffins are simple straight-chain  hydrocarbons, whereas isoprenoids are hydrocarbon chains with branches. Waxes  are long-chain paraffins that are solid at surface temperatures and may contain  as many as 50 carbon atoms. Waxy oils tend to thick and viscous, whereas  aromatic oils tend to be light and volatile.<br />
<br />
Petroleum in ancient times was called bitumen, and mankind for centuries was  not at all sure what bitumen was made of or where it came from. Two ideas  developed in ancient times to explain the composition and origin of bitumen.  One held that bitumen was inorganic and bore no relation to living things,  whereas the other theorized that it somehow formed from once-living plants or  animals.<br />
<br />
Plato and Aristotle discussing philosophy. The ancient Greek philosopher  Aristotle taught that everything we touch or feel is made up of the base  elements of earth, air, fire and water. These elements are never found in a  pure state and consist of a mysterious matrix infused with the properties of  warm and dry, or the opposing properties of cold and wet. Earth was dry and  cold, air wet and hot, fire dry and hot, and water wet and cold.<br />
<br />
Aristotle believed that stones, ores and fossils form as deposits from  exhalations deep within the earth that are trapped in pores and fissures. Wet  exhalations produce metals, dry ones produce stones. Aristotle's followers  suggested that the foul smell associated with most bitumen indicated that it  was a form of liquid sulfur, a compound they attributed to dry exhalations.<br />
<br />
Two theories on the origin of petroleum developed during the Renaissance. The  more popular was proposed by Agricola, a German physician who agreed with  Aristotle and wrote in 1546, in a textbook on mining and minerals, that bitumen  formed from exhalations of sulfur deep within the earth. By contrast, Libavius,  another German physician, theorized in 1599, in a chemistry textbook, that  bitumen might form from the resins of ancient trees.<br />
<br />
Leo Lesqueroux, the father of paleobotany, decided in 1866 that petroleum in  Pennsylvania formed from marine algae in Devonian shales much the same way that  coal forms from land plants. Later, Anderson and Arnold convincingly argued in  a 1907 bulletin of the U.S. Geological Survey that the only possible source for  oils from Santa Maria field in California was microscopic fossil plants, called  diatoms, found in organic-rich shales of the Miocene Monterey Formation.  Another bulletin by Clarke in 1916 demonstrated that the Santa Maria oils were  chemically similar to, and therefore undoubtedly derived from, the organic  remains of Monterey diatoms. <br />
Some geologists  believe that crude oil formed over millions of years from the remains of tiny  aquatic plants and animals that are exposed to the combined effects of time and  temperature. In other words, oil forms from organic matter that is either  &quot;cooked&quot; deep within the earth for long periods of time at low  temperatures, or &quot;cooked&quot; for short periods of time at high  temperatures.&nbsp; Others believe that it is  formed relatively quickly from layers upon layers of organic matter (aquatic  plants, animals of other living matter) via an exothermic biological process  and that it takes eons of years to accumulate the volume of oil we find in  wells.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
<img width="237" height="158" src="index3_clip_image001_0002.jpg" alt="http://evofh1l.devhub.com/img/upload/OIL03.jpg" align="left" /><br />
Fossil  organic matter is called kerogen, and sulfur-rich kerogens form oil sooner, and  at lower temperatures, than other types of organic matter. This is because  atomic bonds between carbon and sulfur break much easier than carbon-oxygen  bonds. Kerogen in the Monterey Formation, the main oil source rock for Kern  County, was deposited in oxygen-deficient, deep-ocean waters that promoted the  formation of sulfur. Thus, organic-rich Monterey shales generate oil easier  than other oil source rocks. The down side is that sulfur-rich oils are more  difficult to refine, and therefore not as valuable, as other oils.<br />
<br />
Most crude oil formed from one-celled plants and animals, called plankton,  which floated on the surfaces of ancient oceans. As these organisms died, they  settled to the ocean floor and were covered with mud. If the mud did not  contain enough oxygen for the soft parts of these organisms to decay, then the  organic material was converted into kerogen. If enough kerogen remains, it may  later be converted into oil.<br />
<img width="228" height="152" src="index3_clip_image001_0001.jpg" alt="http://evofh1l.devhub.com/img/upload/OIL01.jpg" align="left" /><br />
Kerogen in  the Monterey Formation is derived mainly from diatoms, which are one-celled  planktonic plants with microscopic shells of silica. Thus, some organic-rich  Monterey shales are also called diatomaceous shales. Other types of plankton,  as well as bacteria that feed on decaying plankton, make up most of the kerogen  in many of the oil source rocks that are important in other parts of the world.  Diatoms and other forms of marine plankton tend to form what is called Type-II  kerogen.<br />
<br />
Some oils formed from non-marine algae and bacteria that grew in ancient lakes.  Examples are some of the oils found in the Far East and Central Africa, as well  as oils in the oil shales of Wyoming and Colorado. Non-marine algae and  bacteria form Type-I kerogens.<br />
<img width="228" height="150" src="index3_clip_image001_0000.jpg" alt="http://evofh1l.devhub.com/img/upload/OIL04.jpg" align="left" /><br />
The woody  remains of land plants form coal, which is Type-IV kerogen, whereas the soft  parts, mainly spores and pollens, form gas-prone Type-III kerogens. Thus, land  plants do not form kerogens conducive to oil formation. Because the Sacramento  basin of California contains source rocks with primarily of Type-III kerogens,  the Sacramento Valley has many gas fields with very few oil fields.<br />
<br />
In summary, most crude oil was formed underwater from microscopic plants and  animals that accumulated over millions of years and where layers of buried organic  matter created exothermic conditions that favored oil creation. Given deeper  burial, with sufficient time to accumulate and exothermic insolated conditions,  the soft parts of these organisms, were converted to oil which accumulated into  the oil fields we find today.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
