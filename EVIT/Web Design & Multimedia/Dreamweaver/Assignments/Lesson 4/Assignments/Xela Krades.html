<p>Xela Krades was once a human who desired the power to do all the things he wanted to do in life, but understood that it would take longer than his life span. At a young age, he devised a plot to gain the power he required, but knew that it would take years to put into action. At the age of 20, he had the opportunity to do it, but it required years of solitude and much bloodshed. Like most humans, he had a conscience, so he thought about it for a week. During that week, he judged the morality and logicality of what he needed to do to achieve his ultimate goal. Also, this situation gave many demons an opportunity to posess him. A contest of mischief was held on his planet that would decide who would control him. A nameless but powerful demon won. During posession, Xela was unaware that his actions and thoughts were not his own. Because of this, he decided to do what he set out to do. He abducted and sacrificed dozens of people, making sure that there was no way to connect him to the crimes. Police units pieced things together eventually, but by then he already slaughtered enough people to take one trip. When he arrived, he decieved Jack Fenton by telling him how much he liked ghosts. He founded the L.O.V. as a result of his inability to be in more than one world at a time without reducing his power by some degree. <br />
<p>His original and oldest power is the ability to absorb one's power(s) by defeating them in some kind of a competitive event. Xela When Xela gained his 16th <a href="Xela'sAbilities.html">ability</a>, the demon took complete control. When this happened, his human personality and body were overwhelmed, and Xela became a prisoner in his own mind.
<p>The demon restructured Xela's body into what it was when the host was 17 years old. Its whole personality had surfaced: a meniacal, devious, patient, deceitful genius whose main goal was collecting abilities to become all- powerful. As the days went by, he grew bored from his lack of followers. This gave him an idea for forming an organization that he could use to rule multiple dimensions without having to make a personal appearance. So, for 3 years, he redefeated his former challengers and recruited them to his secret society. built up his organization until it was so vast, he could barely keep all of them under control. For 7 months, there were uprisings and rebellions, one of which almost obliterated his body.<br /> 
<p>After that, the remainder of his body teleported itself to his personal comet, where he regenerated and planned for 3.5 months.
<p>When he returned, he stated that his first task at hand was to eliminate the unloyal traitors that disbanded from the L.O.V., and restore and rebuild the L.O.V. This mass termination was the Great Purge of the L.O.V. 
<p> <br />
  The 3.5 months that passed was the first Dark Age of the organization. Members that were once skillful and tactful became reckless and unorganized. Wars broke out between branches of the organization, as well as their original adversaries. <br />
