<p>There were several events that led to the collapse of the L.O.V.. </p>
<p>The primary reason that L.O.V. met its demise was the constant pursuit and confrontation of multiple Galactus's. This drastically depleated the organization's resources, time, and members.  These search-and-destroy missions occupied much of the time and energy of the organization's best trackers and fighters. Even Sartogen had a hard time fighting him. When Sartogen saw that his obsession to recruit Galactus was destroying the organization that played a major part in maintaining the balance of good and evil in multiple universes, he decided to temporarily cease the search. What Sartogen had done had already angered Galactus, so he put Sartogen on the top of his hit list.</p>
<p>The secondary cause of the organization's downfall was caused by the elimination of members of the board of directors at the hands of a group that called themselves TRUMP. This caused an imbalance of leadership within the L.O.V., as well as a resentment towards an organization ruled by one being. Though Sartogen foresaw this, he was unable to end the constant assassination attempts that he experienced. This forced him to create a clone that had the same powers and power level as he did.</p>
<p>The tertiary cause of the L.O.V.'s fall occurred twenty years after <a href="Xela'sDemise.html">Sartogen met his demise</a>. Before he died, he split the organization into three groups. The groups had erased all data of the L.O.V.'s existence, including the defunct constitution. The groups started bickering among each other, and it did not take long for them to believe that they could not settle their individual differences without conflict. This led to <a href="Warof3P's.html">The War of the 3 P's</a>.. </p>
