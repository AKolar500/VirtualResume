<p>The War of the 3 P's is the only remaining recorded event that postitively confirms that the L.O.V. even existed. The 3 P's refer to the 3 groups in conflict with one another: Passion, Power, and Perseverance. 3 earth years into the war, there was a recorded total of 19 battles, 730 member casualties, and 5,000,000 civilian casualties. </p>
<p>Most of the civilian casualties occurred because of misfired/dodged attacks. Sometimes, when a high-powered attack was made, an enormous backsplash occurred. If it hit an individual/population, the damage could range from mild injury to massive simultaneous non-existence.</p>
<p>Because the groups used  destroy-on-sight tactics, the battles usually started spontaneously and ended just as quickly.</p>
<p>Few of the member casualties were executed without assistance from outside parties. Usually, the groups demanded funding and technology to assist in the elimination of opposing groups. Until the 11th year of the war, the requests were always fulfilled.</p>
<p>Because of the assistance of outside parties, the war dragged on with no end in sight. By the 12th year of the war, the Power group was nearly victorious. All it needed was 2 more victories and it would win the war.</p>
<p>As a last-ditch effort to turn the tide, Passion and Persevearance formed a temporary ceasfire treaty, which united the two groups. Though they were powerful, they still could not win, so they made a very risky make-or-break move, which was to ask Galactus and The Emperor to help them. They agreed, but all agreed to go their seperate ways after Power was eliminated. </p>
<p>Galactus aided Passion, and The Emperor aided Persevearance. Both groups then proceeded an attack on the most crucial facility of the Power group, Koriban Power HQ. Passion would lead the frontal assault, and Persevearance would infiltrate and dismantle the base from the inside. Though Power expected this, they did not count on The Emperor and Galactus accompanying its enemies, and so the base was easily captured.</p>
<p>Eventually, Power was eliminated, but neither Passion nor Persevearance held their end of the deal. As a result, Galactus and The Emperor quickly finished off all members but one, Sartogen's clone. Thanks to that clone, the L.O.V. continued for 200 more years, but  by that time, the clone's body had deteriorated too much for it to remain an active member.</p>
<p>The clone became aware of this, and so it hid all data of the L.O.V. that remained in a safe and secret location. This data would prove that the L.O.V. existed, and it would give the viewer the tools needed to rebuild the L.O.V. and start its 2nd age. That time may never come... </p>
