<p>	The L.O.V.(League of Organized Villainy) is a fictional orgainization that is directed and maintained by an entity known to few as <a href="Xela Krades.html">Xela Krades</a>. The L.O.V. has existed since the beginning of most universes, and greatly influences most of them. Originally, Xela(a.k.a. Sartogen) personally recruited members, due to his desire for power; after he gained his 42d ability, he felt no need to have any more, since he almost became too powerful to control his actions. The first few members of the organization came up with the group's motto: &quot;Sometimes to take the path of light, you must walk in the shadows.&quot;.
