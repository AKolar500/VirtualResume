<p>This facility was established by Freeza as a training ground for minions. When Xela entered the Dragonball Universe, the first thing he did was infiltrate this complex and defeat Freeza. After Freeza's defeat, the complex was absorbed into the L.O.V. 210 years after that, Baby attacked this facility. Security staff succeeded in driving Baby off, but Baby had damaged the reactor containment shield, thus releasing the anti- matter and absorbing the base. </p>
<p>The main reason that the planet was not absorbed was that the shield surrounding the base had become functional immediately after Baby left. The shield had a special property that nullified the effects of black holes and removes them from existence. </p>
<p>The <a href="DragonballIncidentCasualties.html">casualties</a> were minimal, but this provoked the contruction of enhanced defense systems to forestall this from happening again. </p>
