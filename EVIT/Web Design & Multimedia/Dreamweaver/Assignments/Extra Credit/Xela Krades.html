<p>Xela Krades was once a human who desired the power to do all the things he wanted to do in life, but understood that it would take longer than his life span. At a young age, he devised a plot to gain the power he required, but knew that it would take years to put into action. At the age of 20, he had the opportunity to do it, but it required years of solitude and much bloodshed. Like most humans, he had a conscience, so he thought about it for a week. During that week, he judged the morality and logicality of what he needed to do to achieve his ultimate goal. Another important event that took place during this time was that a contest was being held in hell to decide who would force Xela to take the chance. A powerful demon named Sartogen won, and on the 7th day, it posessed Xela. Though Xela was still aware and in control of his actions, his decisions were being controlled by Sartogen. Because of this, he decided to do what he set out to do. He abducted and sacrificed dozens of people, making sure that there was no way to connect him to the crimes. Police units pieced things together eventually, but by then he already slaughtered enough people to take one trip. He founded the L.O.V. as a result of his inability to be in more than one world at a time without reducing his power by some degree. <br />
<p>His original and oldest power is the ability to absorb one's power(s) by defeating them in some kind of a competitive event. When Xela gained his 16th ability, he no longer had human emotions and needs, and his impatient, caring, weak personality could no longer control the mind of his abilities. When this happened, his human personality and body were overwhelmed, and he retreated into his own mind for 2 years.
<p>When Xela returned from his hibernative state, it became clear that his former self was no more, and was replaced by an entity that was the physical, emotional, and mental opposite of his 24 year-old existence. His body had reverted back to what it was when he was 16 years old. He had become a meniacal, devious, patient, deceitful genius whose main goal was collecting abilities until he became all- powerful. As the days went by, he wanted an So, for 3 years, he built up his organization until it was so vast, he could barely keep all of them under control. For 7 months, there were uprisings and rebellions, one of which almost obliterated his body.<br /> 
<p>After that, the remainder of his body teleported itself to his personal comet, where he regenerated and planned for 3.5 months.
<p>When he returned, he stated that his first task at hand was to eliminate the unloyal traitors that disbanded from the L.O.V., and restore and rebuild the L.O.V. This mass termination was the Great Purge of the L.O.V. 
<p> <br />
  The 3.5 months that passed was the first Dark Age of the organization. Members that were once skillful and tactful became reckless and unorganized. Wars broke out between branches of the organization, as well as their original adversaries. <br />
