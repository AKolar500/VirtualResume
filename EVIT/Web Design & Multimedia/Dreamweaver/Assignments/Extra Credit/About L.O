Xela was once human, with human emotions and needs, but after he gained his 15th ability, his impatient, nervous, weak personality could no longer control his abilities. When this happened, his human personality and body were overwhelmed, and he So, for 3 years, he built up his organization until it was so vast, he could barely keep all of them under control.

After that, the remainder of his body teleported itself to his personal comet, where he regenerated and planned for 3.5 months.
