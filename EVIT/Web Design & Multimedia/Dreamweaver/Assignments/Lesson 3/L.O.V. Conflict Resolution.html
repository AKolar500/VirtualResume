  <p>Steps For Conflict Resolution Within The L.O.V.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="left">Step 1: The matter is discussed with the member(s) that directly outrank(s) the group(s) and/or individual(s) that are approaching conflict. During these conferences, the involved discuss how the matter can be resolved without violent confrontation. Communication is available via Astral Projection. Personal attendance will be used at the member(s) own risk. </p>
  <p align="left">Step 2: If Step  1 is inefficient, all individuals and groups underanking the individuals and/or groups in conflict will become unavailable to the ones in conflict, as well as all resources within the L.O.V. that affect the ones in conflict. This will give the opposers a reason to cease conflict with each other. When that occurs, they will become full- fledged members once more. </p>
  <p align="left">Step 3:  If Step 2 is inefficient, and if the ones in conflict threaten the well- being or stability of the L.O.V., the one(s) that do so will become excluded from the organization and eliminated. </p>
