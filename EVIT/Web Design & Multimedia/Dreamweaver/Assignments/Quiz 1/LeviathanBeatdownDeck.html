<p>This Deck was the most powerful deck that Xela ever designed. It revolved around one main goal: The Special Summoning of The Great Leviathan, a monster with infinite ATK, and a bypassing ability that frightened even Xela himself. The reason that Xela worried is because of a possibility of the existence of a card that can redirect its attack back at him, or worse, the Leviathan itself. </p>
<p>History Lesson:</p>
<p> If anything happened to the Leviathan, he would lose the only thing that enabled him to exist in the Yu-Gi-Oh realm. His fears were confirmed when he saw the card that could do this: Paradox of Eternity. Though this card was heavily guarded, he still worried about its availability. So, through an expertly strategized plan, he created a situation that would deplete and weaken the card's protection, thus allowing him to steal and destroy it. Unfortunately for Xela, this was anticipated, and to make things even more inconvenient, a TRUMP member was waiting for him inside the containment room. After both of them confirmed that the card was still inside the sealed box, the two then proceeded to duel. Throughout the duel, both of their strategies were shot down by their respective opponent. When Xela summoned The Great Leviathan, he proceeded to attack, but by a twist of fate, one of the cards the Leviathan destroyed was Paradox of Eternity. When Xela discovered this, it had already been activated. The significance of this event was that it proved that there is a way to banish Xela to his own dimension, thus crippling the L.O.V. and ensuring its eventual destruction. </p>
