<p>This Deck is Xela's absolute favorite. The main goal of this deck is to eliminate, if not surpress, damage his opponent gives him; while taking out huge chunks of his opponent's Life Points, as well as increase his own. It does this by using two main strategies. </p>
<p>1- He  powers up his monsters then destroys them using Ring of Destruction. The way he escapes the backsplash is by equipping Orichalcos Stone #2 to the monster he is going to destroy. Orichalcos Deuteros has almost nothing to do with surpressing the damage, since it does not immensely increase his Life Points in one session.</p>
<p>2- He sets up combinations to prevent his opponent from attacking what he doesn't want attacked, and then he summons Fire Princess. Next, he tries to increase his Life Points as often as possible.</p>
<p>The only reason Xela is able to set up such combinations quickly is by using the Magic card   Starting A Riot. This allows him to take as many cards as he wants from his deck and add them to his hand, at the cost of 100 Life Points per card.</p>
<p>He also uses a card called Excavation. This has basically the same effect as Starting A Riot, but it involves his Graveyard.</p>
<p>With this deck, he usually wins within 3 turns; he has also bested the Egyptian God Cards by using their own attack points against them. This solely involves Pein, Leader of the Akatsuki.</p>
