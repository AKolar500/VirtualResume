<p>This deck uses Fire Princess, Morale Boost, Gearfried the Iron Knight, and Butterfly Dagger-Elma to decrease his opponent's Life Points to 0 in one turn. He loans this deck to Rebecca Hopkins because if you don't draw the correct cards on your first turn when using this deck, you will likely become extremely annoyed at how easily the FP combo is repelled, leading to your eventual defeat. </p>
<p>Another weakness is that this deck relies too heavily on FP, and it doesn't satisfactorially protect it. The main long- lasting barriers are spell cards, and most of them can be turned against the owner.</p>
