<p class="style1">The relationship between humans and machines changed in the year 2090, when a domestic android named B1-66ER was threatened by its owner. The machine then killed the owner, his pets, and a mechanic instructed to deactivate the robot. This murder was the first incident of an artificially intelligent machine killing a human. B1-66ER is arrested and put on trial, consistently justifying the crime as self-defense, stating that it "simply did not want to die". Using the 1856 Dred Scott v. Sandford case (which implicitly ruled that African Americans were not entitled to citizenship under United States law) as a precedent, the prosecution argued that machines were not entitled to the same rights as human beings, and specifically that human beings have a right to destroy their property, while the defense urged the court not to repeat history, and to judge B1-66ER as a human and not a machine.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, B1-66ER lost the court case and was consequently destroyed.</p>
