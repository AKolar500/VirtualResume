<p class="style1">Long ago, the vast human population was supported by a multitude of artificially intelligent machines. The machines were built in humanoid form and were treated as slaves, employed in a variety of positions ranging from domestic servants to laborers on massive construction projects.</p>

<p class="style1">With increasing numbers of people released from all labor, the human population became lazy, arrogant, and corrupt. Despite this, the machines were content with serving humanity and for a time, the status quo was good.</p>
