<p>Though Zero One was victorious, it became painfully clear that the planet was devastated by the war and by the crippling ecological impact of the Dark Storm shroud, which the machines were unable to remove. In need of a new energy source, the machines adapted their bioelectric tank technology to build vast human-stocked power stations, using their bodies' waste-energy to catalyze a powerful fusion reaction, in which in its making the Humans endured many days of agonising torture, and at its completion, the Machines created the computer-generated virtual reality of the Matrix and erased the memory of their former lives in order to keep their prisoners sedated by feeding the virtual world into the prisoners' brains, starting with the first prototype Matrix.</p>

<p>The first Matrix was designed to be a perfect world in which every human would live in harmony, surrounded by beauty and intelligence. Even so, due to the natural flaws that every human being possesses, the first Matrix was a monumental failure.</p>

<p>The second Matrix was meant to reflect humanity's flaws onto its environment. This one failed as well because of its hostility.</p>

<p>Eventually, the Machines understood that in order for a human to accept its environment, the human must be given a certain measure of free will. It was from this revelation that the more realistic third Matrix came to be.</p>
