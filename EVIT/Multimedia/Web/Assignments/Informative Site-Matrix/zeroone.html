<p class="style1">Some robots escaped destruction thanks to the humans who still wanted them to work. The machine population was exiled, and they created their own nation in the Middle East, named Zero One (or "01", the numerals used in binary notation). The robots built Zero One in "the cradle of human civilization" (an allusion to the Fertile Crescent, apparently located in Saudi Arabia's "Empty Quarter", which was previously devoid of all life). Having established an industrial base, the machines of Zero One began to produce efficient, highly advanced artificial intelligence. The new nation excelled at manufacturing high-tech consumer products, and before long, Zero One's consistent export of cheap, reliable, mass-produced goods began to undercut the global economy.</p>

<p class="style1">The United Nations Security Council called an emergency economic summit at UN headquarters in New York City, which resulted in UN delegates approving of a global economic blockade of Zero One. Two robotic ambassadors, built as a mechanical Adam and Eve, were sent by the leaders of Zero One to peacefully request the admission of their state to the United Nations as a prelude to settling the economic crisis peacefully. Despite their peaceful intentions, the ambassadors were forcibly removed from the chamber, and their application was rejected. Shortly thereafter, the Security Council debates the issue of short-sightedly declaring war on the Machine Empire.</p>
