<p class="style1">Even though most accepted this realistic version, there were some who did not. Among these people was the One. The One was a human being who possessed an anomale inherent in the Matrix that was derived from the Source. This anomale, if left unchecked, would threaten the existence of the Matrix by representing the very nature of the Matrix: choice.</p>

The difficulty of this choice would depend on the One's attatchment to humanity.</p>
