<p>Soon, the United Nations unleashed a sustained nuclear bombardment on Zero One. The nuclear carpet bombing devastated the machine city, but was unsuccessful in destroying many elements of the mechanical population, given that the machines didn't have the same weaknesses to the bombs' fallout and heat like humans. The machines retaliated by unleashing their armies to conquer neighboring human countries, triggering a world war between the United Nations and Zero One. Despite their best efforts, human troops were unable to hold back Zero One's relentlessly efficient onslaught, and slowly retreated. As the machine forces pushed deeper across the planet, military leaders began to pursue increasingly desperate solutions.</p>

<p>At a summit of political and military leaders from around the world, unanimous approval was given to a plan code-named "Operation Dark Storm", which aimed to cut the machines off from the sun, their primary energy source. The plan was executed in 2105, with high altitude bombers dispersing sky-darkening nanomachines into the air, while the human armies simultaneously launched a ground offensive against the machine forces. The plan was initially successful, although many of the human nations' long-range weapons systems were also disabled by the lack of sunlight. With their high-tech weapons rendered useless, human commanders were forced to launch close-quarters infantry engagements, supported by electromagnetic artillery fire and armored assaults using tanks and powered armor.</p>

<p>Legions of a new model of machine, no longer in humanoid form, but more like an insectoid or cephalopod-like form, overran the human armies. This coincided with the destruction of original man-made robots at the hands of human forces and, as a result, the further dehumanization of the rapidly emerging machine collective. As the machine armies swarmed across the human defenses, the United Nations, in desperation, fired nuclear missiles directly at the machine armies, vaporizing their own troops in the process. To make up for the lack of solar power, the machines begin capturing human prisoners and using their bodies to power large biomechanical tanks, which quickly cut through the dwindling human artillery. As the expanding armies of Zero One overran Eurasia, they unleashed lethal biological weapons, which further ravaged humanity.</p>

<p>Eventually brought to its knees by the might of the machine army, the Security Council called a global summit at U.N. headquarters to sign an armistice and end the war. Zero One's machine ambassador signed the peace treaty with a barcode, in which the humans agree to surrender their remaining territories to the machines. <i>"Your flesh is a relic, a mere vessel. Hand over your flesh and a new world awaits you. We demand it."</i> were the only words the machine utters before it detonated a nuclear bomb in the meeting chamber, which killed most of the planet's leaders and destroyed New York City, one of the few remaining human settlements. In 2139, the machines crushed the leaderless remnants of the human armies, and the war ended.</p>
