<h3><span id="The_Second_Renaissance">The Second   Renaissance</span></h3>
<p><em><strong>The Second Renaissance</strong></em> is a two-part film written and directed   by <a title="Mahiro Maeda" href="/wiki/Mahiro_Maeda">Mahiro Maeda</a>. He used <em>Bits and Pieces of Information</em> written by the <a title="Wachowski brothers" href="/wiki/Wachowski_brothers">Wachowski   brothers</a> as a prequel to the series as a base for the first part. The   brothers have acknowledged that they are satisfied with Maeda's version,   apparently despite concerns that the premise contradicts that of the original   film by showing the origins of the Matrix and the human/machine war, of which   character Morpheus confesses himself (and implies all humanity) to be ignorant,   as a record kept in the humans' city.</p>
<h4>[<a title="Edit section: Part I" href="/w/index.php?title=The_Animatrix&amp;action=edit&amp;section=10">edit</a>] <span id="Part_I">Part I</span></h4>
<p>Explained throughout by a computerized narrator known as the Instructor (<a title="Julia Fletcher" href="/wiki/Julia_Fletcher">Julia Fletcher</a>), the film   begins with an introduction to the Zion Archive and the access of &quot;Historical   File 12 &ndash; 1&quot;, &quot;The Second Renaissance&quot;. The screen opens to the image of an   immense <a title="Megacity" href="/wiki/Megacity">megacity</a>, in the near   future, wherein the vast human population is supported by a multitude of <a title="Artificial intelligence" href="/wiki/Artificial_intelligence">artificially intelligent</a> machines. The   machines are built in <a title="Humanoid" href="/wiki/Humanoid">humanoid</a> form   and seem to be treated as slaves, employed in a variety of positions ranging   from domestic servants to laborers on massive construction projects.</p>
<blockquote>
  <div>&quot;In the beginning, there was man. And for a time, it was good. But   humanity's so-called civil societies soon fell victim to vanity and corruption.   Then man made the machine in his own likeness. Thus did man become the architect   of his own demise.&quot;</div>
</blockquote>
<p>With increasing numbers of people released from all labor, the human   population has become lazy, arrogant, and corrupt. Despite this, the machines   were content with serving humanity and, as the narrator states, &quot;for a time, it   [the <em>status quo</em>] was good&quot;. This phrase is a reference to one of the most   famous phrases of <em>Genesis</em>, consistent with the Biblical references seen   throughout the original <em>Matrix</em> films, and is one of numerous references   to <em>Genesis</em> in particular present in &quot;Second Renaissance&quot;.</p>
<p>The relationship between humans and machines changes in the year <a title="2090" href="/wiki/2090">2090</a>, when a domestic <a title="Android" href="/wiki/Android">android</a> named B1-66ER (a possible version   of &quot;Bigger&quot;, the protagonist in <a title="Native Son" href="/wiki/Native_Son">Native Son</a>) is threatened by its owner. The machine   then kills the owner, his pets, and a mechanic instructed to deactivate the   robot. This murder is the first incident of an artificially intelligent machine   killing a human. B1-66ER is arrested and put on trial, but justifies the crime   as self-defense, stating that it &quot;simply did not want to die&quot;. During the trial   scene, there is a voice-over of <a title="Clarence Darrow" href="/wiki/Clarence_Darrow">Clarence Darrow</a> (the defense attorney) quoting   a famous line from the <em><a title="Dred Scott v. Sandford" href="/wiki/Dred_Scott_v._Sandford">Dred Scott v. Sandford</a></em> case in <a title="1856" href="/wiki/1856">1856</a> in his closing statement, which implicitly   ruled that <a title="African Americans" href="/wiki/African_Americans">African Americans</a> were not entitled to   citizenship under United States law. Using this as a precedent, the prosecution   argues that machines are not entitled to the same rights as human beings, and   specifically that human beings have a right to destroy their property, while the   defense urges the listener not to repeat history, and to judge B1-66ER as a   human and not a machine (a longer version of Darrow's closing statement can be   read in the comic <em>Bits and Pieces of Information</em> from <em><a title="The Matrix Comics" href="/wiki/The_Matrix_Comics">The Matrix Comics</a> Volume 1</em>).</p>
<blockquote>
  <div>:&quot;We think they are not, and were not intended to be included, under the   word 'citizens' in the Constitution, and can therefore claim none of the rights   and privileges which that instrument provides for and secures to citizens of the   United States. On the contrary, they were at that time considered as a   subordinate and inferior class of beings...<a href="#cite_note-1">[2]</a>&quot;</div>
</blockquote>
<p>B1-66ER loses the court case and is destroyed. Across the industrialized   world, mass civil disturbances erupt when robots and their human sympathizers   rise in protest. World leaders fear a robot rebellion, and governments across   the planet initiate a major program to destroy all humanoid machines. News   reports show rioting in <a title="United States" href="/wiki/United_States">American</a> and <a title="Western Europe" href="/wiki/Western_Europe">Western European</a> cities such as <a title="Chicago" href="/wiki/Chicago">Chicago</a> and <a title="Berlin" href="/wiki/Berlin">Berlin</a>, alongside the peaceful <a title="Million Man March" href="/wiki/Million_Man_March">&quot;Million Machine   March&quot;</a> on the Albany district courthouse where B1-66ER was sentenced. Visual   references are made to such incidents as General <a title="Nguy&#7877;n Ng&#7885;c Loan" href="/wiki/Nguy%E1%BB%85n_Ng%E1%BB%8Dc_Loan">Nguy&#7877;n Ng&#7885;c Loan</a>'s execution   of <a title="National Front for the Liberation of South Vietnam" href="/wiki/National_Front_for_the_Liberation_of_South_Vietnam">Viet Cong</a> officer <a title="Nguy&#7877;n V&#259;n L&eacute;m" href="/wiki/Nguy%E1%BB%85n_V%C4%83n_L%C3%A9m">Nguy&#7877;n V&#259;n L&eacute;m</a>, the <a title="Tank Man" href="/wiki/Tank_Man">Tank Man</a> standoff following the <a title="Tiananmen Square protests of 1989" href="/wiki/Tiananmen_Square_protests_of_1989">Tiananmen Square protests of   1989</a>, the <a title="Al-Aqsa Intifada" href="/wiki/Al-Aqsa_Intifada">Al-Aqsa Intifada</a> and <a title="The Holocaust" href="/wiki/The_Holocaust">The Holocaust</a>.</p>
<p>Some robots escape destruction when humans still want them to work. The   machine population is exiled, and they create their own nation in the <a title="Middle East" href="/wiki/Middle_East">Middle East</a>, named Zero One (or   &quot;01&quot;, the numerals used in <a title="Binary numeral system" href="/wiki/Binary_numeral_system">binary</a> notation). According to the   narrator, the robots built Zero One in &quot;the cradle of human civilization&quot;, an   allusion to the <a title="Fertile Crescent" href="/wiki/Fertile_Crescent">Fertile Crescent</a>, apparently located in <a title="Saudi Arabia" href="/wiki/Saudi_Arabia">Saudi Arabia</a>'s &quot;<a title="Rub' al Khali" href="/wiki/Rub%27_al_Khali">Empty Quarter</a>&quot; which is   devoid of all life. Having established an industrial base, the machines of Zero   One begin to produce efficient, highly advanced artificial intelligence, echoing <a title="Vernor Vinge" href="/wiki/Vernor_Vinge">Vernor Vinge</a>'s thoughts on   a <a title="Technological singularity" href="/wiki/Technological_singularity">technological singularity</a>. The new   nation excels at manufacturing high-tech consumer products, and before long,   Zero One's consistent export of cheap, reliable, mass-produced goods begin to   undercut the global economy.</p>
<p>The <a title="United Nations Security Council" href="/wiki/United_Nations_Security_Council">United Nations Security Council</a> calls an emergency economic summit at <a title="United Nations Headquarters" href="/wiki/United_Nations_Headquarters">UN headquarters</a> in <a title="New York City" href="/wiki/New_York_City">New York City</a>, resulting in   UN delegates approving of a global economic <a title="Blockade" href="/wiki/Blockade">blockade</a> of Zero One. Two robotic ambassadors, built   as a mechanical <a title="Adam and Eve" href="/wiki/Adam_and_Eve">Adam and   Eve</a>, are sent by the leaders of Zero One to peacefully request the admission   of their state to the <a title="United Nations" href="/wiki/United_Nations">United Nations</a> as a prelude to settling the <a title="Crisis (economic)" href="/wiki/Crisis_(economic)">economic crisis</a> peacefully. Despite their   peaceful intentions, the ambassadors are forcibly removed from the chamber, and   their application is rejected. As this scene unfolds, the narrator states that   &quot;<em>this was not the last time the machines would take the floor there</em>&quot;   foreshadowing the end of Part II. Part I ends as the Security Council debates   the issue of <a title="Myopia" href="/wiki/Myopia">short-sightedly</a> declaring   war on the Machine Empire.</p>
<h4>[<a title="Edit section: Part II" href="/w/index.php?title=The_Animatrix&amp;action=edit&amp;section=11">edit</a>] <span id="Part_II">Part II</span></h4>
<p>Part II opens with United Nations aircraft unleashing a sustained <a title="Nuclear warfare" href="/wiki/Nuclear_warfare">nuclear</a> bombardment on   Zero One. The nuclear <a title="Carpet bombing" href="/wiki/Carpet_bombing">carpet bombing</a> devastates the machine city, but   is unsuccessful in destroying many elements of the mechanical population, given   that the machines didn't have the same weaknesses to the bombs' <a title="Nuclear fallout" href="/wiki/Nuclear_fallout">fallout</a> and heat like   humans. The machines retaliate by unleashing their armies to conquer neighboring   human countries, triggering a <a title="World War III" href="/wiki/World_War_III">world war</a> between the United Nations and Zero   One. Despite their best efforts, human troops are unable to hold back Zero One's   relentlessly efficient onslaught, and slowly retreat. As the machine forces push   deeper across the planet, military leaders begin to pursue increasingly   desperate solutions.</p>
<p>At a summit of political and military leaders from around the world,   unanimous approval is given to a plan code-named &quot;Operation Dark Storm&quot;, which   aims to cut the machines off from the sun, their primary energy source. The plan   is executed in <a title="2105" href="/wiki/2105">2105</a>, with   high altitude bombers dispersing sky-darkening <a title="Nanorobotics" href="/wiki/Nanorobotics">nanomachines</a> into the air, while the human armies   simultaneously launch a ground offensive against the machine forces. The plan is   initially successful, although many of the human nations' long-range weapons   systems are also disabled by the lack of sunlight. With their high-tech weapons   rendered useless, human commanders are forced to launch close-quarters <a title="Infantry" href="/wiki/Infantry">infantry</a> engagements, supported by <a title="Electromagnetic pulse" href="/wiki/Electromagnetic_pulse">electromagnetic</a> <a title="Artillery" href="/wiki/Artillery">artillery</a> fire and armored assaults using <a title="Tank" href="/wiki/Tank">tanks</a> and <a title="Powered exoskeletons in fiction" href="/wiki/Powered_exoskeletons_in_fiction">powered armor</a>.</p>
<p>Legions of a new model of machine, no longer in humanoid form and appearing   more like the <a title="Insect" href="/wiki/Insect">insectoid</a> or <a title="Cephalopod" href="/wiki/Cephalopod">cephalopod</a>-like <a title="List of programs and machines in the Matrix series" href="/wiki/List_of_programs_and_machines_in_the_Matrix_series#Sentinels">Sentinels</a> and others of the <em>Matrix</em> films, overrun the human armies. This coincides   with the destruction of original man-made robots at the hands of human forces   and, as a result, the further dehumanization of the rapidly emerging machine   collective. As the machine armies swarm across the human defenses, the United   Nations, in desperation, fires nuclear missiles directly at the machine armies,   vaporizing their own troops in the process. To make up for the lack of solar   power, the machines begin capturing human prisoners and using their bodies to   power large biomechanical tanks, which quickly cut through the dwindling human   artillery. As the expanding armies of Zero One overrun <a title="Eurasia" href="/wiki/Eurasia">Eurasia</a>, they unleash lethal biological weapons which   further ravage humanity.</p>
<p>Eventually brought to its knees by the might of the machine army, the   Security Council calls a global summit at U.N. headquarters to sign an <a title="Armistice" href="/wiki/Armistice">armistice</a> and end the war. Zero One's   machine ambassador signs the <a title="Peace treaty" href="/wiki/Peace_treaty">peace treaty</a> with a <a title="Barcode" href="/wiki/Barcode">barcode</a>, in which the humans agree to surrender their   remaining territories to the machines. &quot;<em>Your flesh is a relic, a mere vessel.   Hand over your flesh and a new world awaits you. We demand it</em>&quot; are the only   words the machine utters before it detonates a nuclear bomb in the meeting   chamber, killing most of the planet's leaders and destroying <a title="New York City" href="/wiki/New_York_City">New York City</a>, one of the   few remaining human settlements. In <a title="2139" href="/wiki/2139">2139</a>, the machines crush the leaderless remnants of the   human armies, and the war ends.</p>
<p>Zero One is victorious, but it is a <a title="Pyrrhic victory" href="/wiki/Pyrrhic_victory">Pyrrhic victory</a>: the planet has been devastated   by the war and by the crippling ecological impact of the Dark Storm shroud,   which the machines are unable to remove. In need of a new energy source, the   machines adapt their bioelectric tank technology to build vast human-stocked   power stations, using their bodies' <a title="Bioenergy" href="/wiki/Bioenergy">waste-energy</a> to catalyze a powerful <a title="Fusion power" href="/wiki/Fusion_power">fusion</a> reaction, in which in   its making the Humans endured many days of agonising torture, and at its   completion, the Machines create the computer-generated virtual reality of the <a title="Matrix (fictional universe)" href="/wiki/Matrix_(fictional_universe)">Matrix</a> (presumably having erased   the memory of their former lives), to keep their prisoners sedated by feeding   the virtual world into the prisoners' brains, starting with the first prototype   Matrix (as later explained, there were two prototypes of the Matrix before the   finalized, realistic version).</p>
