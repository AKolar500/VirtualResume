  <h2 align="center">What I Believe</h2>
  <p class="p style1">I see the majority of the population of the world as a wicked, hypocritical, destructive bunch that must change.  If man does not change its evil ways, it 
will certainly continue to suffer at its own hands.</p>
  <p class="style1">Over the ages, man has proven that it deserves the day of judgement.  It has killed members of its own kind, it has taken what is not its own, and it has 
also committed countless other detestable actions.  Man has violated itself, and has (figuratively speaking) spat in the face of its creator time and again.  Many of the 
righteous have been slain, and the unrighteous have evaded punishment.  Therefore, the righteous must be upheld, and the unrighteous must be punished.</p>
