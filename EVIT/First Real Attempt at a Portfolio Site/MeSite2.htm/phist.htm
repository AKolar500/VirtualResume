<h2 align="center">My Personal Experiences</h2>
<p class="p style2">Many events have occurred to me over the years, some good and some bad.  Some of the good things include: an IQ test at age 4, hooking a sea lion, making 
powerful friends and acquaintances, collecting things, and more. Some of the bad things include: being ignored and unappreciated at times, and being a subject of mistaken dialogue.</p>
<p class="style2">When I was 4 years old, I displayed terrific memorial skills when I recited a song that I had heard once the day before word for word, tone for tone.  My parents were impressed, and (though I do not know which one, or even if both of them did it) an unidentified party enrolled me in a program for gifted children.  My test results showed that at the time, I had the intelligence of a child twice my age.  The problem with my presence there was that I was very aggressive, yet I could not bear to be away from the one who drove me to the tests; I was pulled from the program.</p>
<p class="style2">During a fishing trip in California, a salmon bit my hook, but I did not realize that it had until I felt a force that was stronger than any salmon that I had heard of pulling on my line.  I tried to keep hold of the rod, but the force was too strong for my pre-adolescent body, so I requested assisstance from my father.  As the event progressed, I noticed a large figure in the water; over time, one of my peers identified it as a seal/ sea lion.  When the chef heard this, he told me that he would give me a soda/ five dollars if the beast was brought onto the boat.  I was disgusted by the events that I imagined that would take place if that man had gotten what he wanted, but I still cheered my father on.  Fortunately, the beast got away, but the party at the other end of the line received the head.</p>
<p class="style2">For a long time, I have been friendly towards my teachers; this attitude has gained me a bond of friendship between me and my teachers.  A good effect of these friendships is that I get to do things that most other students that attend my school are not allowed to do.  Even though I have these priveleges, I am normally respective towards my teachers and I do my best in order to be seen as a hard-working student.  Another positive effect that has occurred is that I have a positive reputation throughout the teachers that work at the campuses that I have used for at least two years.</p>
<p class="style2">Reduced personal attention may be appealing to many at times, but as I am unfortunate enough to know, when it happens frequently, reduced personal attention can make one feel as if one is in a living hell.  Fortunately, this does not happen to me as frequently as it did in the past, but the damage is still there.</p>
<p class="style2">When you have a conversation with someone, do you ever feel violated in any way?  I know that I have.  In the past, I have been verbally abused in front of many people (fortunately not all at once), even though some may not have had the intention to create a series of insults.  Also, in the past, I did not make many attempts to confirm that the dialogue was of an offensive intent; nowadays, I usually do the opposite, but I may seem to be very frank, nosy, and occasionally offensive during my confirmation examinations.</p>
