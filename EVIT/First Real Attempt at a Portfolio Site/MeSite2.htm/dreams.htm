<p class="p style2">The first thing that I hope to do is to go to college in order to get a degree for a job that uses a computer, specifically the laptop type.  The next thing 
that I hope to do is to get a job that I would be qualified for (if I get that higher education).</p>
<p class="style2">As for bigger goals, if given the opportunity, I may also try to steer as many people as I can onto a more pure path.</p>
