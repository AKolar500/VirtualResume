/* How this works on my computer:
In the book's words, "line 1 defines a class." I think that a class is some type of category that holds executables
(or something like that) that will be run once that category is used/activated. I think that line 2 either defines or
creates a location where the command is run. I am sure that line 4 is the executable itself. */
