<p class="firstPara">The more I learned about Hinduism, the more I hated it. When it comes right down to it, the origin of Hinduism is the most wretched one on this site. Why?</p>

<p class="otherPara">In approximately 1500 B.C., a group of Aryans migrated from Iran to northern India through the Hindu Kush Mountains, looking for a place to call their own. On the Indian side of the mountains, these illiterate degenerates found a people who were far more sophisticated than they were. The Indians could read and write and they lived in large cities. The Iranians had none of these qualities, but they had one advantage over the Indians: they were eager to fight. And fight they did.</p>

<p class="otherPara">During the next few hundred years, the Iranians relentlessly attacked the indigenous Indian population and brutally beat the unfortunate locals into submission. Then, the Iranians placed themselves on the thrones of the primitive tribes.</p>

<p class="otherPara">But was that the end of the Indians’ humiliation? Not in the slightest. You see, the Iranians found out that the conquered people would eventually rise up to challenge the legitimacy of the Iranians’ leadership. So, the descendants of the conquering Iranians came up with an ideology that taught everyone to accept their lot in life: Hinduism.</p>

<p class="otherPara">At Hinduism’s heart is a simple notion: There are several classes of human beings, as distinct from one another as worms are distinct from lions. At the top are the “twice-born”. These are men who are favored by the gods; namely the Iranians. Everyone else resided at the bottom: the Shudras (the conquered Indian natives) and the outcastes (foreigners and the exiled).</p>

<p class="otherPara">Those at the top could do anything they wanted to do to those at the bottom. In fact, under the Hindu system, the descendants of the Iranians were born with all the privileges that Hitler’s Nazis would someday dream of. Anyone from a lower caste who jostled a Brahman on the street committed a sin. If he bumped the Brahman with his arm, the arm was cut off. If he touched the Brahman with his foot, the foot was surgically removed. If he sat in a Brahman’s chair, he had a ten-inch red hot rod rammed up his butt. If he complained to the Brahman about this treatment, he had the same smoking piece of metal shoved down his throat.</p>

<p class="otherPara">Furthermore, a Brahman could make any accusation he wanted against a person of a lower caste, and the accused would be punished. But the lower caste citizen could make no complaint against the Brahman.</p>

<p class="otherPara">Why does the Hindu religion tell its adherents to go with the flow, to abhor things of this world, to set aside earthly desires, and to hope only for an improvement of their lot in life after this life is over? Because Hinduism was designed to keep the conquered Shudras in their place. It told those trapped in the lower castes to be content with their humiliation and shun the appalling actions that might spring from desire and discontent. It instructed them never to overthrow their Iranian masters.</p>

<p class="otherPara">My first complaint with this should be obvious: this religion is too damn good at what it was designed to do. These people have been living like this for over a thousand years, and during my research, I have not once found a rebellion that occurred after the year 0. Those Iranians were geniuses! Why can't we follow their example and do the same thing? Oh, that's right: because we aren't living in the bronze age. We don't have to settle for what we have because there are enough resources (except food and living space) for us to be discontent. Those of us living in the 21<sup>st</sup> Century have the luxury of being dissatisfied with our lot in life because it is not the only life we can have.</p>

<p class="otherPara">And I'm not just talking about the people in North America. Any country that does not stifle free speech, can take care of their sick and dying, promotes innovation, and yet still has problems, will always produce people who are easily dissatisfied. Why? Because things like air conditioning, affordable cars, easily-available food, and iPhones spoil a population rotten. Think about it: how do you imagine your life without these wonderful possessions? You expect these things to be around you; you are spoiled. You don't know what it's like to be without these things because you haven't lived in a time without them.</p>

<p class="otherPara">Now, what would these material luxuries do for India? Well, with enough time, they would cause the annihilation of the caste system, which is exactly what will give the Indian people the most freedom at once. These people of the lower castes live worse than slaves, and because of their religion, they can only be eased out of that life by some of the luxuries that you and I enjoy.</p>
