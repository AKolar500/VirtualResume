   <h2 style="color: red">The Basic Stick</h2>
   <p>The Basic Stick is the perfect stick for beginners. The stick rotates slowly to provide extra time for performing stick tricks, but is flashy enough to impress your friends.</p>

<blockquote>

   <p><b>Patented Dura-Coat<sup>&reg;</sup> finish </b>ensures sticks can withstand all weather conditions. More durable than other sticks, these props will keep looking like new for as long as you own them.</p>

   <p><b>Enhanced stick flexibility </b>promotes more bounce, allowing for better tricks. A soft rubber core adds a whole new element to the sticking experience that you have to feel to believe!</p>

   <p><b>Full customization </b>will give you the chance to own a pair of sticks unlike any others out there. I make exactly what you want, with your colors and your designs.</p>

   <p><b>A personal touch </b>through both my customization options and hand-crafted designs.</p>
