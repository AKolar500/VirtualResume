	<p>I cannot understand objects in javascript, even with your sample car application. Most of my problems come from failure to understand how you connect one javascript file to another. Specifically, I don't understand how they communicate, what the deal is with their weird inheritance, and the significance of "prototype" is. This is a new programming language to me, and it looks so different from what I'm used to (C# and Java) that every project is a hassle to me. The fact that so many projects are assigned so often only compounds my stress. The book sucks as a teacher, and I hate looking online for coding help. Please accept my project as it is and grade it accordingly.</p>
